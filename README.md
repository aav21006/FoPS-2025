# FoPS-2025
Notebooks for Fundamentals of Planetary Science 2025 taught at UConn

## Instructions for notebook access:
There are a few options to choose from for accessing the assignment notebooks:

### a. Download the notebook to your computer
You can directly download the notebook by clicking on it's name, navigating to the three dot menu on the right and selecting "Download" from the drop-down.   
Alternatively, if you have git installed on your machine, you can clone this repository to your local machine. 

This option requires that you first have a working python distribution on your computer with the standard set of scientific libraries: scipy, numpy, matplotlib. 

The simplest way to can install python and the other libraries for free is with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success)

### b. Work on a remotely hosted binder server
You can work on a cloud hosted version of the repository called a binder which will run the notebooks interactively through your web browser. The binder session will run as long as the tab is active (it does timeout).  
**VERY IMPORTANT**: In order to preserve any work you do on the binder, you should download the notebook to your computer using the download button. The binder session WILL NOT automatically save your work!   

If you want to be able to come back and continue your work, there is an option to save the notebook to your web browser's cache (for Chrome or Firefox) by clicking on the cloud shaped up button before exiting the binder session. When you re-open a binder session, you can restore the previous session by clicking the cloud-shaped down button. Those buttons are not 100% foolproof so to be safe: SAVE YOUR PROGRESS BY DOWNLOADING THE NOTEBOOK TO YOUR COMPUTER FROM THE BINDER. You can always copy paste into the binder from a file on your computer. 

Live by the ancient motto of computational scientists world-wide: Save early and often. 

Launch the binder server by clicking on the button: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/akuznetsova/FoPS-2025/HEAD)  
(It will take some time, this is normal. In order to start a binder session, it firsts need to download all of the packages in the python environment for which this code runs).   

It should appear as a Jupyter Lab environment from which you can open and start using any of the files in this repository.
